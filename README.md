So this week was rough. I took a day off of work just to try and get caught up & gain some understanding of this module. Though I feel like I've improved it has only been with the help of YouTube & Google. Half of my code is based off of research I did on Google. I watched hours worth of YouTube videos. Rewatched our classes again. But I feel like I've failed myself or like I'm playing myself because I took the knowledge that was given to me & still don't understand all of it. I was nervous to turn in this code because I typed it all myself, but not all of these ideas were mine & I'm at a point now where most of it works, I just dont know how to fix the portion of the code where the questions won't pop up. Now I'm frustrated about the whole thing & feel like throwing this challenge in the trash! :(

I know there's a LOT of Googling & video watching in coding - how else would senior devs or even the junior devs & interns learn? BUT I just don't know how to retain every bit & piece of it in the short time we have in this class. I can apply some of what I've learned in real life but I would be apprehensive to & might need some guidance. Maybe this is a normal feeling for someone who is so new to coding - but this week was a TOUGH challenge to get through. I have notes upon notes upon NOTES just about this week. Crazy times!

Anywho... thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. Please don't hurt me too bad with my grade. :)
